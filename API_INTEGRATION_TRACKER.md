# 📡 API Integration Tracker — Lubist Mobile ↔ Backend

> Single source of truth for which backend endpoints have been wired into the
> mobile app (Expo RN + TanStack Query). Keep this updated as we integrate.
>
> **Backend base URL:** `http://localhost:8000` · **Global prefix:** `/api/v1`
> **Backend repo:** `g:\vescavia\Projects\backend` · **Mobile repo:** `g:\vescavia\Projects\lubist_mobile_application`
> **Shared with:** salon web admin panel (same backend)

## How to use this doc

- Each endpoint row tracks: **Method**, **Path** (after `/api/v1`), **Auth**, **TanStack hook**, **Consuming screen**, **Status**.
- Update the **Status** and the **Progress summary** every time we integrate or change something.
- When asked to "continue API integration", I (Claude) read this file first to know where we left off.

### Status legend
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⬜ | Not started |
| 🟡 | Hook created (not yet wired to a screen) |
| 🟢 | Wired into UI (works end-to-end, not formally tested) |
| ✅ | Verified / tested |
| ➖ | Not needed on mobile (admin/web-only) |

## 🧱 Integration infrastructure (foundation)

| Item | Status | Notes / TODO |
|------|--------|--------------|
| TanStack Query provider | ✅ | `src/app/providers/AppProviders.tsx` |
| Base fetch client (`apiGet`/`apiPost`) | 🟢 | `src/services/api/client.ts` — **added auth headers, PUT/PATCH/DELETE helpers, and auto refresh-on-401** |
| Device location (`expo-location`) | 🟢 | `src/services/location/useDeviceLocation.ts` — **GPS + permission flow, used by ClientHome** |
| Razorpay checkout (WebView) | 🟢 | `src/features/client/components/RazorpayCheckout.tsx` — **Expo Go-compatible; native SDK avoided** |
| Auth token storage | 🟢 | `src/services/storage/tokenStorage.ts` — **using `expo-secure-store` persistence** |
| AuthContext (real session) | 🟢 | `src/store/AuthContext.tsx` — **holds real token + user, auto-restores login on launch** |
| Query key conventions | ⬜ | Define a `queryKeys` factory once we add `useQuery` reads |
| Centralized error handling | ⬜ | Map backend `{detail}` shape to UI toasts |
| Env config per environment | 🟡 | `src/app/config/env.ts` hardcodes localhost — add staging/prod |

> ⚠️ These foundations should be finished early — most read endpoints below need an
> auth header, and almost every protected route needs the real AuthContext.

## ⚠️ Bookings — standalone `/api/v1/bookings/*` router does not exist

> The dedicated `bookings.py` router was removed. All customer-facing booking
> operations now live under `/customers/bookings/*` (see Customers section).
> Vendor booking management is under `/vendors/bookings/*`.
> Admin booking management is under `/admin/bookings/*`.

> **Service cart / favorites / reviews are complete.** Product-cart is now wired as part of

> CartScreen's "Proceed to Checkout" is still a placeholder until **Product Orders** is wired.
>
> **Coupons (NEW)** — checkout now supports coupon codes. `POST /customers/cart/validate-coupon`
> `{code}` previews a coupon against the current cart and returns `{valid, reason, coupon_id,
> coupon_code, breakdown}`; then pass `coupon_code` into `/payments/cart/create-order` and
> `/customers/cart/checkout`. Build an "Apply coupon" field on CheckoutScreen. **Full build spec
> (all three frontends, payloads, reason messages) → [`backend/docs/COUPONS_UI_SPEC.md`](../backend/docs/COUPONS_UI_SPEC.md).**
> See the **Coupons** section below for the endpoint rows.
>
> **Product favorites (NEW)** — `/customers/favorites/products` (GET/POST/DELETE) added so the
> Saved tab shows saved products alongside saved salons. Hooks live in `useProductsAPI.ts`
> (`useFavoriteProducts` / `useAddFavoriteProduct` / `useRemoveFavoriteProduct`). Save toggle is a
> heart on ProductDetail; the Saved → Products segment (ClientAccountScreen) renders + un-saves them.
> ⚠️ Requires the `product_favorites` table migration (`supabase/migrations/20260613000000_*`).
> See **[`PRODUCT_FAVORITES_API.md`](../backend/docs/PRODUCT_FAVORITES_API.md)** in the backend repo —
> this feature is **not yet in the salon web admin panel** and will need a UI there to stay in sync.

## 🎟️ Coupons — customer checkout (`/api/v1/customers` + `/api/v1/payments`)
File: `backend/app/api/customers.py`, `backend/app/api/payments.py` ·
**Full UI spec:** [`backend/docs/COUPONS_UI_SPEC.md`](../backend/docs/COUPONS_UI_SPEC.md)

| Method | Path | Auth | Hook | Screen | Status |
|--------|------|------|------|--------|--------|
| POST | `/customers/cart/validate-coupon` | bearer | `useValidateCoupon` (NEW) | CheckoutScreen ("Apply coupon" field) | ⬜ |

| POST | `/customers/cart/checkout` | bearer | `useCheckoutCart` (+`coupon_code`) | CheckoutScreen | 🟢 (needs coupon arg) |

**Flow:** user types a code → `validate-coupon` returns `{valid, reason, breakdown}` → show
applied chip + update price summary (`service_total_due` = pay at salon, `convenience_fee_due` =
pay now, `total_amount`, "You save ₹X") → pass `coupon_code` into create-order + checkout.
Re-validate whenever the cart changes. Reason strings are display-ready (see spec §6).
The booking response gains `discount_amount`, `convenience_fee_discount`, `coupon_id`, `coupon_code`.

> ➖ **Vendor coupon management** (`/vendors/coupons` CRUD) and **admin coupon management**
> (`/admin/coupons` CRUD) are **web-only** (salon-management-app vendor dashboard + salon-admin-panel).
> Not needed in the customer mobile app — see the spec for those surfaces.

## 🔭 Backend v2 / gap notes (to discuss)

Candidates we flagged for a possible `/api/v2` or backend tweaks to better serve mobile:

- [ ] **Home-feed aggregation endpoint** — combine `popular-cities` + `nearby` + `categories` into one call to cut mobile round-trips on `ClientHomeScreen`.
- [ ] **Consistent pagination** (cursor-based) across list endpoints for infinite scroll.
- [ ] **Canonical booking surface** — `/customers/bookings/*` is the client surface; `/vendors/bookings/*` for vendors.
- [ ] **Slimmer mobile DTOs** — some list responses may be heavier than mobile needs.
- [ ] _(add items here as they come up)_

_Last updated: 2026-06-13 (Coupons & discounts: NEW customer `POST /customers/cart/validate-coupon`
+ `coupon_code` on `/payments/cart/create-order` & `/customers/cart/checkout` (mobile: add an
"Apply coupon" field on CheckoutScreen + `useValidateCoupon`); vendor CRUD `/vendors/coupons` and
admin CRUD `/admin/coupons` are web-only. Full build brief for all three frontends:
backend/docs/COUPONS_UI_SPEC.md. Totals 139→150.) ·
Earlier: Product favorites: new backend `/customers/favorites/products`
GET/POST/DELETE + `product_favorites` table; wired `useFavoriteProducts`/`useAddFavoriteProduct`/
`useRemoveFavoriteProduct` into ProductDetail (heart toggle) and the Saved tab's Products segment
(ClientAccountScreen, previously hardcoded). Backend tests added; see backend/docs/PRODUCT_FAVORITES_API.md.
Also fixed the 2-column product grids on Shopping + Saved tabs (were rendering one card per row).) ·
Earlier: Products rollout phases 1–3: wired `useProductsAPI.ts` →
ClientShopping (categories + featured), ProductCatalog (list/search/category filter),
ProductDetail (by id), plus product-cart (add / qty / remove) on those screens + CartScreen,
with live cart-count badges. Remaining: `clear/all` UI + product-orders checkout.) ·
Earlier same day: audit against live backend removed 34 phantom endpoints — standalone /bookings router, /location/geocode, /payments/booking+history+earnings+webhook, dead /salons + /rm + /upload + /admin endpoints; fixed /auth/resend-verification auth to bearer; total 170→136) · Maintained jointly by the team + Claude Code._
